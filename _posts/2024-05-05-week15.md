title: Week 15 - The Presentations
---

Make your blog post. Reflect on the presentations from this week and your group's progress.

This week, I got to see what all the other groups had been working on this whole time. They all presented very well and were super clear in explaining their work and their experience with open source, their specific projects and their collaborators/community. One of my favorite presentations was for GitLab, because they put effort into keeping the slides entertaining. I also really enjoyed the freeCodeCamp presentation, just because I am interested in the project.

As far as my group's progress, we were able to meet up and complete our presentation this week. Thankfully, we even got a chance to rehearse. However, we weren't able to get our latest PRs merged, which is a bit unfortunate all things considered, but I don't see why we can't continue to make edits until the issues we're signed up for are fully resolved. We're looking forward to talking about our experience on Monday and showing off what we've learned!
