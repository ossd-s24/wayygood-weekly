The projects that we've looked at in class are super impressive, with so many people contributing
to create projects that can be helpful to thousands more. I'm really excited to work specifically on
getting better at debugging and design. I think the biggest challenge will be finding a way to improve
something so vast that many have already tried and succeeded in improving. I plan to overcome them by
learning as much as I can about the features and trying them out myself so I can get a better idea of what I want to do.
